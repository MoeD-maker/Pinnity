Fix: Businesses Not Showing on Admin Dashboard Due to Missing verificationStatus Field

---

### ❗ The Problem

Newly created businesses (vendors) are not appearing on the admin dashboard because the `verificationStatus` field is missing or undefined at creation.

The admin dashboard filters vendors using:

```ts
business.verificationStatus === 'pending' || business.verificationStatus === 'pending_verification'
If a vendor is created without a verificationStatus, it will:

Not show up on the admin panel

Not be counted in pending/approved/rejected stats

Possibly break the frontend with “Invalid response format”

✅ What You Need to Do
1. Locate the Business Creation Logic
Look in one of these files (whichever contains vendor registration or business onboarding):

vendor.routes.ts

auth.routes.ts

business.routes.ts

OR the relevant function in server/storage.ts

2. Add Default Verification Status
Update the db.insert(businesses).values(...) call to include this field:

ts
Copy
Edit
verificationStatus: 'pending'
✅ Example Before:
ts
Copy
Edit
await db.insert(businesses).values({
  name: req.body.name,
  userId: req.user.id,
  ...
});
✅ Example After:
ts
Copy
Edit
await db.insert(businesses).values({
  name: req.body.name,
  userId: req.user.id,
  verificationStatus: 'pending',
  ...
});
✅ Bonus: Update Existing Records (Optional but Recommended)
Also create a one-time script to update existing businesses missing a verification status:

ts
Copy
Edit
await db.update(businesses)
  .set({ verificationStatus: 'pending' })
  .where(isNull(businesses.verificationStatus));
Save this as a script like fix-missing-verification.ts and run it once.

✅ Outcome
After this fix:

All new vendors will have verificationStatus = 'pending' by default

The admin dashboard will correctly show and approve new vendors

The red “Failed to fetch businesses” error will disappear

The backend will return consistent, valid business data
