Replit Prompt: Fix Deal Approval Workflow Issue
I've discovered a critical issue with our deal approval workflow. When I create a new deal using a vendor account (ziad@vendor.com), the deal immediately appears live to customers, completely bypassing the required admin approval process.

Please fix this issue by implementing the following changes:

1. **Deal Creation Status Check**
   - Verify that the `/api/deals` POST endpoint correctly sets new deals to "pending" status
   - Add a direct status check in the deal creation controller to ensure every new deal gets the "pending" status unless created by an admin
   - Add a server-side log entry when deals are created to record the initial status
   - Ensure businessId and userId are properly validated during creation

2. **Deal Visibility Rules**
   - Update the consumer-facing API endpoints to exclude deals with "pending" status
   - Add user-role based filtering to getDeals() and getFeaturedDeals() methods:
     - For regular customers: Only return deals with "approved" or "active" status
     - For vendors: Return ALL their own deals but clearly indicate "pending" status
     - For admins: Return all deals with appropriate status indicators
   - Ensure the getDealsByBusiness(businessId) method returns ALL deals including pending ones when called by the vendor who owns that business

3. **Status Indicators for Vendors**
   - Add clear "Pending Approval" status indicators on vendor dashboard for deals awaiting approval
   - Include estimated approval time information 
   - Add a "Draft" status for deals that are saved but not yet submitted
   - Consider adding an "Edit" option for pending deals that haven't been approved yet

4. **Permission Verification**
   - Verify that the vendor account isn't incorrectly assigned admin privileges
   - Add explicit logging when deal status changes occur
   - Ensure the ownership check is working properly for vendor-specific deal retrieval

5. **Admin Dashboard Update**
   - Ensure the admin dashboard shows pending deals clearly
   - Add a notification system for admins when new deals require approval

Please prioritize fixing this issue as unapproved deals are currently visible to all customers. The expected behavior is:
1. Vendor creates a deal → Status is set to "pending"
2. Deal appears in vendor's dashboard as "pending approval"
3. Deal appears in admin approval dashboard
4. Deal is NOT visible to regular customers
5. Admin approves deal → Status changes to "approved" or "active"
6. Only then should the deal become visible to customers

This is a high-priority fix as it impacts our approval workflow and quality control process.
