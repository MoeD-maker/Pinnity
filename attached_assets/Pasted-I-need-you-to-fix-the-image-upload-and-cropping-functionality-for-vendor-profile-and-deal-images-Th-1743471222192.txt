I need you to fix the image upload and cropping functionality for vendor profile and deal images. The current implementation in ImageUploadWithCropper.tsx and ImageCropper.tsx has several issues that need addressing:

## Key Issues:

1. **Aspect Ratio Not Enforced**: The current implementation allows vendors to select different aspect ratios in the cropper, but we need to strictly enforce:
   - 1:1 square format for business logos
   - 4:3 landscape format for deal images

2. **Final Dimensions Not Validated**: While there's initial validation on upload, the cropped output isn't validated to ensure it meets minimum pixel dimensions.

3. **Unclear Visual Guidance**: Vendors need clearer visual guides to understand the exact dimensions required.

## Required Changes:

1. **ImageCropper.tsx**: 
   - Remove the "Aspect Ratio" tab completely OR make it read-only to show the required ratio
   - Lock the aspect ratio based on the `cropShape` and `aspectRatio` props passed in
   - Add pixel dimension indicators showing the cropped image's current pixel size
   - Add prominent warnings if the cropped area will be below minimum requirements

2. **ImageUploadWithCropper.tsx**:
   - Validate the final cropped image dimensions before accepting
   - For business logos: Enforce MINIMUM 300×300px, recommend 500×500px
   - For deal images: Enforce MINIMUM 600×450px, recommend 800×600px
   - Add clear visual indicators showing the pixel dimensions of the current crop
   - Prevent form submission if images don't meet the requirements

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Add a dimension readout showing "Current: 450×337px" during cropping
   - Use color coding (red/green) to indicate when dimensions meet requirements
   - Add example thumbnails showing how images will appear in different app locations

## Implementation Guidelines:

1. For business logos, disable all aspect ratio options except 1:1
2. For deal images, disable all aspect ratio options except 4:3
3. Calculate and display the actual pixel dimensions of the cropped area in real-time
4. Add a clear indicator in the cropper UI showing "MINIMUM SIZE" vs "RECOMMENDED SIZE"
5. Block the "Apply Changes" button if the cropped area is below the minimum pixel dimensions

The final solution should ensure that all uploaded images strictly adhere to our size and aspect ratio requirements without exception.
