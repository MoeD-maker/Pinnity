Please implement improvements to help users understand how featured deals relate to filters and regular deals. Add these features:

Add an explanatory message when filters are applied:

Show a small info banner explaining that featured deals are always shown
Position it between the featured deals section and filtered regular deals


Add a clear visual divider between featured and regular deals:

Create a section divider with "Regular Deals" text
Make this especially visible when filters are active


Consider adding a toggle in the filters to include/exclude featured deals (optional)

Here's code to guide your implementation:
jsxCopy{/* After the featured deals section, before regular deals */}
{(showFilters || selectedCategories.length > 0 || searchQuery) && (
  <div className="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-lg mb-4 text-sm flex items-center">
    <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-500 mr-2 flex-shrink-0" />
    <p>
      Featured deals are always shown regardless of filters. 
      {filteredDeals.length > 0 ? 
        " Regular deals below match your selected filters." :
        " No regular deals match your current filters."}
    </p>
  </div>
)}

{/* Section divider */}
<div className="relative my-8">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center">
    <div className="w-full border-t border-gray-200"></div>
  </div>
  <div className="relative flex justify-center">
    <span className="bg-white px-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      {filteredDeals.length > 0 ? 
        `${filteredDeals.length} Regular Deals` : 
        "No Matching Regular Deals"}
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

{/* Optional filter toggle */}
<div className="space-y-2">
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
    <Label className="text-sm font-medium">Include Featured Deals</Label>
    <Switch
      checked={includeFeatured}
      onCheckedChange={setIncludeFeatured}
      aria-label="Include featured deals in results"
    />
  </div>
</div>
These changes will help users understand the relationship between featured deals, filters, and regular deals, creating a better user experience.
