I'd like to enhance our deal card design to make business branding more prominent and improve the overall customer experience. Please implement these specific improvements:

1. **Business Identity Upgrade**
   - Create a dedicated business identity area at the top of the content section (just below the image)
   - Add a larger business logo (at least 40x40px) aligned left with the business name
   - Display the business name and logo in a horizontal arrangement with proper spacing
   - Add a subtle verified checkmark badge next to verified business names

2. **Recurring Deal Indicators**
   - For recurring deals, add a clear "Available on: Tuesdays & Thursdays" indicator below the expiration date
   - Use a calendar or clock icon to visually distinguish this from regular expiration info
   - When a recurring deal is viewable on an "available day," add a green "Available Today" badge

3. **Information Hierarchy Adjustments**
   - Keep the discount percentage (50%) prominent in the top right as it is now
   - Move the category tag ("Food & Dining") to align with the business information
   - Add subtle visual separation between the business info and deal description
   - Keep distance and expiration information grouped together as they currently are

4. **Quick Action Improvements**
   - Add a share icon button alongside the heart/favorite button
   - Ensure the QR code/scan icon is clearly visible and properly labeled
   - Make the "View Deal" CTA more prominent with a color that contrasts with your brand colors

5. **Deal Status Enhancement**
   - For deals ending soon (< 3 days), change expiration text to highlight urgency ("Ending soon: 2 days left")
   - For highly popular deals, add a subtle indicator showing popularity ("Popular: 50+ redeemed")
   - For new deals (< 3 days old), add a "New" badge near the title

Please maintain the overall clean, card-based aesthetic while implementing these changes. All enhancements should be responsive and maintain proper proportions across device sizes.
