Based on my findings, here are answers to your questions:

1) Current User ID Retrieval Method in DealDetail.tsx
DealDetail.tsx now uses the centralized getCurrentUserId() function from the userUtils.ts module:

// Import statement
import { getCurrentUserId, getCurrentUser } from '@/utils/userUtils';
// Inside the component 
const userId = getCurrentUserId();
This function is used in three main places in DealDetail.tsx:

Line 92: In the checkRedemption function to get the user ID for checking redemption status
Line 155: In the addToFavorites mutation to get the user ID for saving deals to favorites
Line 231: In the handleRedemptionSuccess function to get the user ID for re-checking redemption status
2) RedemptionDialog.tsx Implementation
RedemptionDialog.tsx also properly uses the centralized getCurrentUserId() function:

// Import statement (line 16)
import { getCurrentUserId } from '@/utils/userUtils';
// In the handleVerifyCode function (line 43)
const userId = getCurrentUserId();
It uses this function twice:

Line 43: To check if a user is authenticated before proceeding with verification
Line 75: To get the user ID for creating a redemption record if one wasn't already created
3) Benefits of Centralized User Data Access
The implemented centralized user data access method offers significant benefits to the codebase:

Consistent Retrieval Logic: The same user ID retrieval logic is applied across components, eliminating inconsistencies.

Backward Compatibility: The centralized utility handles multiple storage formats (new format with pinnity_user_id, legacy format with userId, and older format with a full user object), ensuring that user IDs can be retrieved regardless of which authentication method was used.

Error Handling: The utility includes proper error handling and logging, making debugging much easier when user ID issues occur.

Maintenance: With user ID retrieval logic in one place, future changes to authentication can be made in a single location.

Type Safety: The utility returns a properly typed user ID (either a number or null), improving TypeScript type checking.

Enhanced Debugging: The centralized function includes helpful console logs that identify when legacy formats are being used, facilitating future migrations.

The system is now well-structured and has addressed the systematic inconsistency in user authentication data retrieval that was causing redemption issues. The code is more reliable and maintainable with this centralized approach.
