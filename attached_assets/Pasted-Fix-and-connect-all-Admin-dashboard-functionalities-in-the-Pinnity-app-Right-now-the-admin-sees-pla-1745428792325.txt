Fix and connect all Admin dashboard functionalities in the Pinnity app. Right now the admin sees placeholder/test data. Here's the checklist:

🔐 1. Protect All Admin Routes
In all /admin/* pages (e.g., admin/index.tsx, admin/deals/index.tsx, admin/vendors/index.tsx), wrap the component with:

tsx
Copy
const { user } = useAuth();
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || user.userType !== "admin") {
    navigate("/login");
  }
}, [user]);
✅ Only users with userType === "admin" (like admin@test.com) should access those routes.

📊 2. Wire Up Dashboard Stats (admin/index.tsx)
In /admin/index.tsx, remove or replace mock data like stats.pendingDeals = 7.

Un-comment and implement:

tsx
Copy
const response = await apiRequest("/api/admin/dashboard");
setStats(response.stats);
If the /api/admin/dashboard route doesn’t exist yet, create it in admin.routes.ts:

ts
Copy
app.get("/api/admin/dashboard", authenticate, authorize("admin"), async (req, res) => {
  const stats = {
    pendingDeals: await db.countDeals({ status: "pending" }),
    activeDeals: await db.countDeals({ status: "approved" }),
    pendingVendors: await db.countBusinesses({ verificationStatus: "pending" }),
  };
  res.json({ stats });
});
🧾 3. Fix Vendor Approvals Dashboard (admin/vendors/index.tsx)
This page should fetch businesses where:

sql
Copy
verificationStatus = 'pending'
Make sure the API returns this list.

Show them in a table with action buttons:

✅ Approve → update status to verificationStatus = "verified"

❌ Reject → mark them accordingly

🎟️ 4. Fix Deal Approvals Dashboard (admin/deals/index.tsx)
This page must fetch deals where:

sql
Copy
status = 'pending'
Show the list of deals with title, business name, discount, and dates.

Add buttons:

✅ Approve → set status = "approved"

❌ Reject → set status = "rejected"

📥 5. Make Sure Vendor Deal Submissions Set status: "pending"
Already handled in deal.routes.new.ts:

ts
Copy
status: "pending"
✅ Confirm that vendor-side form uses this route and the deal is being saved properly.

✅ Final Test:
Login as admin@test.com

Approve a new business

Approve a submitted deal
