🚨 Critical Fix Needed: Admin Dashboard is Still Showing Mock Numbers and Missing Pending Deals/Vendors

---

### 🛠️ Root Cause

The frontend admin dashboard is still fetching data from an outdated or mock endpoint (`/admin/dashboard`) instead of the new real endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/dashboard`), which returns live pending deals and vendors.

As a result:
- ❌ Mock stats are displayed (hardcoded numbers)
- ❌ No real pending deals or vendors are shown for approval
- ❌ Admin actions are not possible

The backend is already fixed and properly returns live sanitized data.

### ✅ What Needs To Be Fixed

#### 1. Update Frontend API Call

Find the frontend code that fetches dashboard data, likely in:

client/src/pages/admin/index.tsx client/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx client/src/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx

sql
Copy
Edit
(or similar)

➡️ Update the `fetch` or `axios` call from:

```ts
fetch('/admin/dashboard') // ❌ wrong
to:

ts
Copy
Edit
fetch('/api/v1/admin/dashboard') // ✅ correct
Make sure the method is GET and headers include authentication if required.

2. Update How You Read API Response
The new API structure looks like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "stats": {
    "pendingDeals": number,
    "activeDeals": number,
    "rejectedDeals": number,
    "expiredDeals": number,
    "pendingVendors": number,
    "totalUsers": number,
    "alertCount": number
  },
  "recentActivity": [ 
    {
      "id": number,
      "title": string,
      "status": string,
      "businessName": string,
      "createdAt": timestamp
    }
  ]
}
➡️ Update your frontend to read:

ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/admin/dashboard');
const data = await response.json();

const pendingDeals = data.stats.pendingDeals;
const pendingVendors = data.stats.pendingVendors;
const totalUsers = data.stats.totalUsers;
const recentActivity = data.recentActivity;
3. Remove Any Hardcoded Mock Numbers
If you find code like:

ts
Copy
Edit
const pendingDeals = 5; // ❌ hardcoded
const pendingVendors = 8; // ❌ hardcoded
➡️ Delete those and rely fully on the live API response values.

4. Render Live Data for Approval Tables
Wherever you render pending deals and vendors (like in an approval table or review panel), use the live recentActivity or fetch detailed deals/vendors separately if needed.
