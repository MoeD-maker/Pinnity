Both of my signup forms — `IndividualSignupForm.tsx` and `BusinessSignupForm.tsx` — are broken and stuck on the error “You must accept the Terms and Conditions.”

The root cause is that submission logic is either:
- Missing
- Miswired
- Or blocked by incorrect structure

Nothing gets logged in the console. Validation does not run. Form submission fails silently.

### ❗ STOP PATCHING — REBUILD BOTH FORMS FROM SCRATCH

I want you to throw away the current implementation and fully recreate the following two files:

---

## ✅ 1. IndividualSignupForm.tsx (for general users)

Include the following fields:
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email`
- `password`
- `confirmPassword`
- `phone`
- `address`
- A checkbox for **termsAccepted**, using: `z.literal(true)`

Requirements:
- Use `react-hook-form` with `zodResolver`
- Use `<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>` wrapping all elements
- Use `setValue("termsAccepted", !!checked)` for the checkbox
- Use a **submit button inside the form** with `type="submit"`
- Log the full `data` object inside `onSubmit`
- Validate and show an error if `termsAccepted` is not true

---

## ✅ 2. BusinessSignupForm.tsx (for vendors)

Fields to include:
- `businessName`
- `category` (select dropdown with: Restaurant, Retail, Services, Hospitality, Entertainment, Other)
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email`
- `password`
- `confirmPassword`
- `phone`
- `address`
- Labels (or real inputs) for: Government ID, Proof of Address, Proof of Business Ownership
- A checkbox for **termsAccepted**, using: `z.literal(true)`

Requirements:
- Same as individual form: react-hook-form + zod
- Submit button **inside the form**
- Terms checkbox must be registered properly with validation
- Log the full data object
- Optional file uploads should log filenames (can mock upload handler)

---

## ✅ Final Checklist for Both

- Forms must submit via `handleSubmit(onSubmit)`
- Checkbox state must be managed with `setValue` and validated with `z.literal(true)`
- Console must show `SUBMISSION PAYLOAD: ...` when submitting
- Submit button must be inside the form and trigger validation

Please rebuild both files completely — do NOT try to patch the old ones. Follow the above layout exactly.
