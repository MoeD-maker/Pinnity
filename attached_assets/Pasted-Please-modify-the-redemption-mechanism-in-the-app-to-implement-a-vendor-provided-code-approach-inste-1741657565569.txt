Please modify the redemption mechanism in the app to implement a vendor-provided code approach instead of the current customer-generated code. Make the following changes:

1. VENDOR DASHBOARD - Redemption Verification Section:
   - Create a new "Verify Redemption" section in the vendor dashboard
   - Implement a searchable/filterable list view of all active deals from the business
   - For each deal, display:
     * Deal title
     * Deal type (percent off, BOGO, etc.)
     * Start/end dates
     * Redemption PIN code (prominently displayed)
     * Total redemptions used/available
   - Add a quick-copy button next to each PIN
   - Add a search function to filter deals by title or category
   - Group deals by status (active, upcoming, expired)

2. KEEP EXISTING PIN GENERATION IN DEAL CREATION:
   - Maintain the current "generate pin" functionality in create.tsx
   - Continue allowing vendors to either generate a random code or input their own
   - Add a small informational tooltip explaining that "This pin will be provided to customers at redemption time"

3. CUSTOMER SIDE CHANGES:
   - Modify the DealDetail.tsx component to change the redemption flow
   - In the "How to Redeem" tab, update the instructions to explain the new process:
     * "1. Visit [Business Name]"
     * "2. Request the redemption pin from staff"
     * "3. Enter the pin below to redeem your deal"
   - Replace the current redemption code display with a PIN entry field
   - Add a "Redeem" button that validates the entered PIN against the deal's stored PIN
   - Show appropriate success/error messages based on PIN validation and redemption limits

4. BACKEND VERIFICATION LOGIC:
   - Update the redemption API endpoint to verify:
     * The entered PIN matches the deal's PIN
     * The user hasn't exceeded redemption limits
     * The deal is still active
   - Track individual user redemptions in the database as before
   - Ensure the vendor can see real-time redemption counts

5. FLOW IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Add visual confirmation on successful redemption
   - Create a "Recently Redeemed" section in the user's profile
   - Implement error handling for incorrect PINs with helpful messages

Please update all necessary components to maintain UI consistency and ensure the redemption process is intuitive for both vendors and customers.
